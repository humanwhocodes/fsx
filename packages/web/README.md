## Description

The humanfs bindings for the [Origin Private File System (OPFS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_API/Origin_private_file_system) in web browsers.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is **experimental** and may change significantly before v1.0.0. Use at your own caution and definitely not in production!

## Installation

It's recommended to import the minified version to save bandwidth:

```js
import { hfs } from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/@humanfs/web?min";
```

However, you can also import the unminified version for debugging purposes:

```js
import { hfs } from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/@humanfs/web";
```

## Usage

The easiest way to use hfs in your project is to import the `hfs` object:

```js
import { hfs } from "@humanfs/web";
```

Then, you can use the API methods:

```js
// 1. Files

// read from a text file
const text = await hfs.text("file.txt");

// read from a JSON file
const json = await hfs.json("file.json");

// read raw bytes from a text file
const bytes = await hfs.bytes("file.txt");

// write text to a file
await hfs.write("file.txt", "Hello world!");

// write bytes to a file
await hfs.write("file.txt", new TextEncoder().encode("Hello world!"));

// append text to a file
await hfs.append("file.txt", "Hello world!");

// append bytes to a file
await hfs.append("file.txt", new TextEncoder().encode("Hello world!"));

// does the file exist?
const found = await hfs.isFile("file.txt");

// how big is the file?
const size = await hfs.size("file.txt");

// copy a file from one location to another
await hfs.copy("file.txt", "file-copy.txt");

// move a file from one location to another
await hfs.move("file.txt", "renamed.txt");

// delete a file
await hfs.delete("file.txt");

// 2. Directories

// create a directory
await hfs.createDirectory("dir");

// create a directory recursively
await hfs.createDirectory("dir/subdir");

// does the directory exist?
const dirFound = await hfs.isDirectory("dir");

// copy the entire directory
hfs.copyAll("from-dir", "to-dir");

// move the entire directory
hfs.moveAll("from-dir", "to-dir");

// delete a directory
await hfs.delete("dir");

// delete a non-empty directory
await hfs.deleteAll("dir");
```

If you'd like to create your own instance, import the `WebHfs` constructor:

```js
import { WebHfs } from "@humanfs/web";

const hfs = new WebHfs({
	root: await navigator.storage.getDirectory()
});
```

If you'd like to use just the impl, import the `WebHfsImpl` constructor:

```js
import { WebHfsImpl } from "@humanfs/web";

const hfs = new WebHfsImpl({
	root: await navigator.storage.getDirectory()
});
```
